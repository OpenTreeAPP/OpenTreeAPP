> The cabon sequestration potential of ten year old coconut tree (Tall or Dwarf) were 18 to 28 kg per tree per year approximately. 

> The period of study considered was 2003 to 2018 (15 years).
During the period of 15 years coconut plantation
in Vellore district sequestered carbon, which vary
from 76479 t during 2003-04 to 72295 t during
2017-18. 

> Thus, coconut plantation in Vellore
district sequester 1.15 million tonnes of CO2,
which accounts for an average of 20 kg per tree
per year.
