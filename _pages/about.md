## Current situation of global warming
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global temperatures need to be kept from rising by more than 1.5°C. We've already passed 1°C. 

According to experts, we're on track for an increase of between 3°C and 4°C by 2100.And these are only global average temperatures. 
At the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be higher – possibly even double.

> Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

## We need to act now
Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

Carbon capture is necessary to combat global warming and climate change.

Technology is being explored to remove CO2 – the biggest culprit – from the atmosphere, but they are expensive and complex.

> There is a simpler solution – and it’s our most powerful weapon in the fight against climate change: trees.

## Our most powerful weapon: trees
>Trees are the ultimate carbon capture and storage machines. Like great carbon sinks, woods and forests absorb atmospheric carbon and lock it up for centuries. They do this through photosynthesis.

>The entire woodland ecosystem plays a huge role in locking up carbon, including the living wood, roots, leaves, deadwood, surrounding soils and its associated vegetation.

## Planning for the future

>Tackling this crisis now means leaving the world in a liveable state for future generations.

>We want everyone to connect with and recognise the importance of trees and woods in our lives, from distant rainforests to the landscape on our doorstep. 

>By working with schools and communities, we’re empowering people to take the fight against climate change into their own hands.
