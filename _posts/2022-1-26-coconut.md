>coconut had a high carbon storage capacity which was measured at 24.1 tons carbon per hectare per year.


>Productive and sustainable coconut farming ecosystems are potential “carbon sinks” that can minimize the effects of climate change, according to Dr. Severino S. Magat of the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA).

>A recent study on the carbon storage capacities (CSC) of agricultural ecosystems in the country found that coconut had a high carbon storage capacity which was measured at 24.1 tons carbon per hectare per year.

>Coconut was also found to have the most stable carbon storage, being a perennial crop with almost nil burning of crop residues in place at the farm compared to other agricultural crops such as rice and sugarcane.

>coconut plantations or farm ecosystems could be used to reduce CO2 emissions via carbon capture or sequestration in the crop-soil system through: 

>1) substitution of fossil fuel using biodiesel or biomass from coconut oil, 2) sequestration of carbon in coconut plantation, mono-crop or with intercrops, 3) enhancing C sequestration through coconut plantation management, and 4) conserving carbon sink in coconut farms.
