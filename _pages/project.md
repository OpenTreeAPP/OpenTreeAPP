## Current situation of global warming
Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

According to experts, we're on track for an increase of between 3°C and 4°C by 2100.And these are only global average temperatures. 
At the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be higher – possibly even double.
