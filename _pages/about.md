Carbon capture is necessary to combat global warming and climate change. So I decided to plant a tree.

# Our most powerful weapon: trees
>Trees are the ultimate carbon capture and storage machines. Like great carbon sinks, woods and forests absorb atmospheric carbon and lock it up for centuries. They do this through photosynthesis.

>The entire woodland ecosystem plays a huge role in locking up carbon, including the living wood, roots, leaves, deadwood, surrounding soils and its associated vegetation.

# Planning for the future

>Tackling this crisis now means leaving the world in a liveable state for future generations.

>We want everyone to connect with and recognise the importance of trees and woods in our lives, from distant rainforests to the landscape on our doorstep. 

>By working with schools and communities, weâ€™re empowering people to take the fight against climate change into their own hands.
