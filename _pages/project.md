# Current situation of global warming

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global temperatures need to be kept from rising by more than 1.5°C. We've already passed 1°C. 

According to experts, we're on track for an increase of between 3°C and 4°C by 2100.And these are only global average temperatures. 
At the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be higher – possibly even double.

> Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

# We need to act now
We need to seriously reduce our emissions, and find a way of reducing the damage already done. 

Technology is being explored to remove CO2 – the biggest culprit – from the atmosphere, but they are expensive and complex.

> There is a simpler solution – and it’s our most powerful weapon in the fight against climate change: trees.
