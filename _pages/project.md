## What is OpenTree Project
> Open license public Trees for schools and communities.

Trees are one of the best ways to capture and store atmospheric carbon.

We want to make sure everybody has the chance to plant a tree.

> So we’re giving away trees to schools and communities. 

Together, we'll get more trees in the ground.

## OpenTree Goals
> We do need to plant more trees and leave the world in a liveable state for future generations.

## OpenTree Policy
- We need to act now.
- we need more trees.
- we need to protect the ones we already have.
- we do need to plant more trees, quickly.
- We need to start planting for the future.

### We need to act now
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global temperatures need to be kept from rising by more than 1.5°C. We've already passed 1°C.

Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 

> We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.



### We can do
Climate change is a huge and complex issue and, as individuals, we can feel helpless. But there is something we can do – and that's increasing tree and woodland cover.

### The best ways and simpler solution
We need to seriously reduce our emissions, and find a way of reducing the damage already done.

Technology is being explored to remove CO2 – the biggest culprit – from the atmosphere, but they are expensive and complex.

### Trees do more than just capture carbon
They also fight the cruel effects of a changing climate. 

- They can help:
  * Prevent flooding
  * Reduce city temperature
  * Reduce pollution
  * Keep soil nutrient-rich
