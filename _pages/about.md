## Current situation of global warming
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that global temperatures need to be kept from rising by more than 1.5°C. We've already passed 1°C. 

According to experts, we're on track for an increase of between 3°C and 4°C by 2100.And these are only global average temperatures. 
At the poles and over land (where people live), the increase may be higher – possibly even double.

> Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

## We need to act now
Global warming is happening at a faster rate than ever. 
We’re in a climate emergency and it’s threatening our planet.

> Carbon capture is necessary to combat global warming and climate change.

## Our most powerful weapon: trees
Technology is being explored to remove CO2 – the biggest culprit – from the atmosphere, but they are expensive and complex.

> There is a simpler solution – and it’s our most powerful weapon in the fight against climate change: trees.

## The ultimate carbon capture and storage
Trees are the ultimate carbon capture and storage machines. Like great carbon sinks, woods and forests absorb atmospheric carbon and lock it up for centuries. They do this through photosynthesis.

> The entire woodland ecosystem plays a huge role in locking up carbon, including the living wood, roots, leaves, deadwood, surrounding soils and its associated vegetation.

## Planning for the future
Tackling this crisis now means leaving the world in a liveable state for future generations.

> By working with schools and communities, we’re empowering people to take the fight against climate change into their own hands.
